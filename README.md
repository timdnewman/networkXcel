# networkXcel
Sometimes the only tool you're given is excel, and sometimes you need to analyse a network, and sometimes - if you're really unlucky - both are true.

I'm going to try and implement a lot of functionality from networkx. Given its vba there are going to be a lot of compromises.

Initially I'm going to have some functions to do a minimum - predominantly the linear algebra based one becuase excel is actually good at that
* Graph representations
   * Create an adjacency matrix
   * Create a bi-adjacency matrix
   * I think we can do a dictionary based graph
* Network properties
   * Degree
   * Etc.
* Utilities
   * Connected
   * Bi-partite
   * Unique nodes
   * Etc
